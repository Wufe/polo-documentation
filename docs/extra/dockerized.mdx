Polo can also be run inside a docker container.  
Since the common use case of Polo is to run containers itself, we use an image capable of connecting to the host container socket.  

## The configuration

The containers Polo will run need to start on the same network of the Polo's container, in order to perform a direct connection to them.  

Here there's an [example testserver.yml](https://github.com/Wufe/Polo/blob/main/docker/dockerized-testserver.yml) that makes use of these concepts.  
As you may notice, we don't need to expose the session containers' ports anymore since we are performing a direct container-to-container connection.  
The connection is performed using the short container id (first 12 characters).

## Usage

- We first need to create a shared network.  
    This will get used by Polo and the containers it is going to start.

```bash
docker network create polo-net
```

- We then start polo linking the configuration file and the docker socket.

```bash
docker run -d \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v "$(pwd)/application.yml:/app/application.yml" \
    --name polo \
    -p 7777:7777 \
    -w /app \
    --network polo-net \

```
