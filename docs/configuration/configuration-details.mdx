## List of options

If you want to look for a list of available options you may want to head to the [example-configuration.yml](https://github.com/Wufe/Polo/blob/main/examples/example-configuration.yml) file.

## Edit of a configuration

As of now to add a new configuration file, you must restart the Polo service.  
To update an existing application configuration, you don't need a restart.  

## Composition

A configuration file is composed by the part which controls the configuration of the entire service (i.e. **global**) and the part which configures the list of all applications (i.e. **applications**).  

***

### Global

Sample global configuration object:

```yml
global:
  port: 59876
  sessions_folder: ./.sessions
  max_concurrent_sessions: 10
```

**port**  
Is the main port the service will listen on.

**sessions_folder**  
Is the folder path where the sessions will be stored.  
This folder will contain copies of your defined repository based on the sessions that get started.  

**max_concurrent_sessions**  
States the max number number of sessions that may be started concurrently.  

***

### Applications

Minimal application configuration:

```yml
applications:
  - name: 'HelloWorld'
    remote: 'https://github.com/lorem/ipsum'
    commands:
      start:
        - command: 'lorem ipsum'
      stop:
        - command: 'lorem ipsum'
  - name: 'AnotherApplication'
    remote: ...
```

**name**  
*required*  
Represents the name of the application.  
This name will be displayed into the Polo dashboard.  

**remote**  
*required*  
The remote repository from which the code will be fetched.  

**target**  
*default: http://127.0.0.1:{{port}}*  
Given a session started executing a list of commands, the underlying application will be listening on one or more ports.  
This option defines where to navigate to when joining a session.  
Polo works as a reverse proxy, so it needs a target address.  

Here you can use [runtime defined variables](#runtime-defined-variables) to compose your target url.  
These variables get created when executing start, stop or clean commands.  

The *port* variable is different though: you can create as many port variables as you want, by just adding a number to the variable *port*.  
Polo will automatically find an available free port.  

**host**  
As a reverse proxy, Polo allows to set a Host to use while performing HTTP calls.  

**is_default**  
*default: false*  
States whether the application should be served first.  
This means that if a user gets onto the Polo application without passing by the dashboard (e.g. navigating to `http://localhost:8888` instead of `http://localhost:8888/_polo_/`)
and there's an application flagged as **default** with a branch flagged as **main**, this branch will be served automatically.  

**use_folder_copy**  
*default: false*  
When starting a session, Polo will perform a git clone of the repository by default.  
If *use_folder_copy* is set to true, the service will perform a copy of the files instead.  
Use this setting if you are confident about your disk IO speed and not your network speed.  

**clean_on_exit**  
*default: true*  
If this option is set to true, the internal session folder used to start the service gets deleted once the session gets disposed.  

**max_concurrent_sessions**  
Limits the number of max concurrent sessions for this application.  

***

### Port

Sample port configuration:  
```yml
port:
  except:
    - 9876
```

If you are planning to use a certain number of ports later on the same host, you may want to exclude these ports
from getting used by Polo.

***

### Commands

Commands are separted into start, stop and clean commands.  
The first get called when starting a session, the second when stopping it and the third when cleaning it.  
The cleaning process starts when a session fails to start and after a session gets stopped.  

For each command you have a set of options:  

**command**  
The actual command you are going to perform.  
It can include a [runtime defined variable](#runtime-defined-variables) by using curly braces for interpolation.  

**output_variable**  
The output of the command gets saved into a variable called after the value of this field.  

**continue_on_error**
*default: false*  
If this field is set to false, the execution gets halted once this command throws an error.  

**timeout**  
*default: 0 (in seconds)*  
If this field has a value greater than 0, the command will halt if it last more than set seconds.  

**working_dir**  
*default: ./*  
The directory from which the command will be performed.  

**environment**  
A list of `KEY=value` strings representing environment variables that will be set executing the command.  

**start_healthchecking**  
*default: false*  
If this option is set to true, the process of healthchecking gets started as soon as this command ends its execution:
normally the healthcheck (if configured) starts after all commands get executed.  

***

### Helper

The helper is the element that gets added to a session to allow navigating between sessions.  
It is an unobtrusive menu printed on a corner of the screen:

import helper1 from '/img/helper/helper1.png';
import helper2 from '/img/helper/helper2.png';

<img src={helper1} alt="The session helper" width="200" />
<img src={helper2} alt="The session helper" width="200" />
<br /><br />

Sample helper configuration:

```yml
helper:
  position: bottom-left
```

**position**  
*default: bottom-left*  
Can be one of:  
- bottom-left
- bottom-right
- top-left
- top-right

***

### Fetch

Sample fetch configuration:

```yml
fetch
  interval: 60
```

**interval**  
*default: 60 (in seconds)*  
States how much time to wait to perform a fetch of all branches, tags and commits from the repository.

***

### Headers

Sample headers configuration:

```yml
headers:
  add: []
  set: []
  replace:
    - Origin=host2.example.com
  del:
    - X-Powered-By
```

The **headers** configuration includes four properties for forwarding headers to the underlying application
like a reverse proxy does:  
- **add** allows you to add an header on each request
- **replace** allows you to replace an existing header's value, only if that header exists on the request
- **set** allows you to set a specific header to a specific value if that header exists or not (if it does not exist, it will be added)
- **del** deletes an header

***

### Healthcheck

Healthchecking is a process that helps Polo understand if an application's session is really available or not.  
It performs HTTP requests to an endpoint to check if the underlying application is available.  

If a session is not available, its status will be flagged as `degraded` and it won't be available for navigation.  

Sample healthcheck configuration:  
```yml
healthcheck:
  method: GET
  url: /
  status: 200
  max_retries: 5
  retry_interval: 30
  retry_timeout: 20
```

**method**  
*default: GET*  
The HTTP method used for performing the request.

**url**  
*default: /*  
The URL to be requested.

**status**  
*default: 200*  
The status we are going to expect if the application is ready.  

**max_retries**  
*default: 5*  
Max amount of retries before stating that the application is not available.  

**retry_interval**  
*default: 30 (in seconds)*  
Interval used before performing a retry.  

**retry_timeout**  
*default: 20 (in seconds)*  
The HTTP request timeout.  
If the timeout is exceeded, the request will fail.

***

### Startup

Sample startup configuration:
```yml
startup:
  timeout: 300
  retries: 5
```

The startup options are used while starting up a new session.  

**timeout**  
*default: 300 (in seconds)*  
The time after which the session is considered to have failed to start.  
If max number of retries has been reached, the session will not start again.  

**retries**  
*default: 5*  
Amount of retries before stating that the session cannot be started.

***

### Recycle

Sample recycle configuration:  
```yml
recycle:
  inactivity_timeout: 120
```

A started session gets automatically disposed after a certain amount of seconds of inactivity.  
To change this inactivity timeout, you must change the recycle parameter.   

**inactivity_timeout**  
*default: 3600 (in seconds)*  
Seconds of inactivity after which the session gets automatically disposed.  

***

### Forwards

The forward settings allow to forward specific routes to other destinations
or to set additional settings.  
The route is identified by a regex pattern.

Sample forwards configuration:
```yml
forwards:
  - pattern: ^/path/(.+)$
    to: http://127.0.0.1:{{port2}}/$1
    host: host2.example.com
    headers:
      add: []
      set: []
      replace:
        - Origin=host2.example.com
      del:
        - X-Powered-By
```

In this sample configuration,
when the user navigating the website hits a path like the one defined in the **pattern** field, 
its call gets redirected to another port, setting a specific host and specific headers for that call.  

We can say it sorta works like a *urlrewrite*.

**pattern**  
The regex for which the additional settings or the re-routing will be applied.  

**to**  
The destination of the re-routing.  
Its default value is the **target** field specified in the main application configuration object.

**host**  
The HTTP host forwarded to the application.  

**headers**  
The headers to be set when hitting this path.  
Same as [root application configuration object's headers](#headers).

***

### Branches  

Branches configuration are branches-specific configuration.  

Sample branches configuration:  
```yml
branches:
  - test: ^dev$
    watch: true # The branch will be automatically started and updated at each commit
  - test: ^main$
    watch: true
    main: true
  - test: ^feature/.*
    watch: false
    host: ''
    remote: ''
    target: ''
    helper:
      position: 'bottom-left'
    forwards: []
    headers:
      add: []
      del: []
      set: []
      replace: []
    healthcheck:
      method: GET
      url: /
    startup:
      retries: 3
    recycle:
      inactivity_timeout: 1200
    commands:
      start: []
      stop: []
      clean: []
    port:
      except: [9876]
```

**test**  
Is the regex by which a branch is recognized.  

**watch**  
*default: false*  
Allows a branch to always have a started session and to automatically refresh its content if its checkout gets updated  
(e.g. if something new gets commited into a branch).  

**main**  
*default: false*  
States that this branch is going to be the main branch, so if a user hits the root of the service (i.e. `http://localhost:8888` instead of `http://localhost:8888/_polo_/`)  
its request gets automatically redirected to the **default** application's **main** branch.  
This means that if *main* is set to true, *watch* is automatically set to true.

List of settings you can add to a branch configuration, that can act as overrides of the application's:  
- commands
- forwards
- healthcheck
- helper
- host
- port
- recycle
- remote
- startup
- target
- warmup

***

## Runtime defined variables  

Some string settings like **target** or **command** can be interpolated with runtime defined variables.  
These variables are created while starting a session, with the **output_variable** parameter,
or by letting a command output a string formatted like this:  

`polo[key=value]`

For example you can provide a command like this:  

```yml
- command: 'docker run -p {{port}}:80 -d polo-testserver:{{commit}} | xargs -I % echo "polo[container_id=%]"'
```

This command prints out `polo[container_id=2ab8fc...]`.  
This variable can thus be reused in other commands.  

There's a set of already defined variables:  
- **uuid**: the UUID of the session  
- **name**: the name of the session; it corresponds to the branch name, the tag name or the commit id  
- **port**: the first provided free port the session will use to start the underlying service  
- **target**: the target URL the session will point to  
- **commit**: the commit hash of the session  

One special variable is **port**:  
if you need more than one available port for your application, you can interpolate a *port2* or *port3*
into your commands and these port variables will have available network ports.
