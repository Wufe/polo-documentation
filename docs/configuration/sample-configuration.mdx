## Creation

We are now creating a sample configuration which serves a generic application using docker.

Copy and paste this yaml configuration into a file named **test-server.yml*+ and place it in the same folder of the executable:
```yml
applications:
  - name: TestServer
    remote: "https://github.com/wufe/polo-testserver"
    is_default: true
    commands:
      start:
        - command: docker build --no-cache -t polo-testserver:{{commit}} .
        - command: docker run -p {{port}}:3000 -d polo-testserver:{{commit}}
          output_variable: container_id
        - command: docker image prune -f
          continue_on_error: true
      stop:
        - command: "docker kill {{container_id}}"
          continue_on_error: true
        - command: docker rm -f {{container_id}}
          continue_on_error: true
        - command: docker image prune -f -a --filter label=name=polo-test-server
    recycle:
      inactivity_timeout: 180
    startup:
      retries: 5
    branches:
      - test: ^dev$
        watch: true
```

Restart Polo and head to `http://localhost:8888` (8888 is the default port).  
You should now see the application TestServer.  

It will take a while to load the application the first time (depending on connection speed).  

In the dashboard you should see the list of all available branches and tags to create a session from.

## Overview

With this sample file we are configurating an application called **TestServer**.  
Its main repository is **https://github.com/wufe/polo-testserver**.  
There are a list of commands for starting and stopping the application.  

Further info about the configuration options can be found in the [next page](/docs/configuration-details).
