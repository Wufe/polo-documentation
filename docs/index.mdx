Polo is a single executable application for managing the lifecycle of an application, in a precise point in time.  
This allows to build a staging environment which can spawn multiple versions of the same application.   

You decide how the application needs to be started.  
Tipically you may want to use Docker to containerize the application and launch it using simple commands.  

## Configuration files

Configuration files must be placed in the same folder of the executable.  
Once the application is started, they are continuously watched for changes.

## Compatibility

Polo is built for:
- MacOS (Intel)
- Linux AMD64
- Windows AMD64

## Glossary

- **Application**: represents the main configuration (backed by a .yml file) used to start your application
- **Checkout point**: is a single commit you may want your application to start from; it can be represented as a **branch**, a **tag** or a precise **commit hash**
- **Session**: is an application started at a precise **checkout point**; a session gets built, navigated into, stopped and recycled

## Getting started

In order to get started we must follow the [installation](/docs/installation) process and configure a sample application.
