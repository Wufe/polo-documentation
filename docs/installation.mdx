# Installation

The process of installation of the application is simple enough:  

- Download the application according to your operating system at [https://github.com/Wufe/Polo/releases](https://github.com/Wufe/Polo/releases).

    Supported operating systems are:
    - MacOS (Intel)
    - Linux AMD64
    - Windows AMD64

- Depending on your operating system you may want to give execution permissions.  
    For example you need to run `chmod +x ./polo-linux-amd64` on linux

- Create a [sample .yml file](/docs/sample-configuration) and put it in the same folder of the application.  

- Now start the application (e.g. `./polo-linux-amd64` on linux)

The application will listen by default on the port 8888
